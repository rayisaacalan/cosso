# cosso

The COSSO regularization method [(Lin, Zhang 2006)](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0702659) automatically
estimates and selects important function components by a
soft-thresholding penalty in the context of smoothing spline
ANOVA models. Implemented models include mean regression,
quantile regression, logistic regression and the Cox regression
models.
